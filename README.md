### How to use
1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Start the daemon on the computer you want to manage.
3. Drag your finger across the screen.

Data is transmitted over UDP multicast, so the devices must be on the same network segment.

Data protection is not provided, so do not run the application on an unsecured network.
